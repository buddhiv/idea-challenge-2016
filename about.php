                        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Project Idea 1:</h5>

                        <p>
                            To build a mobile app that can be used to calculate "Personal Carbon Credits" (PCC) for
                            students.<br/>

                            • If you cycle to school, you get 9 PCC per km.<br/>
                            • If you walk to school, you get 8 PCC per km.<br/>
                            • If you use public transport by train, you get 7 PCC per km.<br/>
                            • If you use public transport by bus, you get 6 PCC per km.<br/>
                            • If you use private transport by electric car, you get 5 PCC per km.<br/>
                            • If you use private transport by hybrid car, you get 4 PCC per km.<br/>
                            • If you use private transport by petrol/diesel car and 4 people travel in the car, you get
                            3 PCC per km.<br/>
                            • If you use private transport by petrol/diesel car and 3 people travel in the car, you get
                            2 PCC per km.<br/>
                            • If you use private transport by petrol/diesel car and 2 people travel in the car, you get
                            1 PCC per km.<br/><br/>

                            For example, if you walk 1 km to bus stop, take the bus for 5 kms and then take the train
                            for 20 kms and a bus for 3 kms, you total PCC is 8+(6*5)+(7*20)+(6*3) = 196.<br/><br/>

                            Version 1: The app should allow the student to enter the data on a daily basis. The student
                            can see a graph of PCC change over time.<br/>
                            Version 2: The app should allow the data to be uploaded to a central server. The server
                            collects data from many students and create a "Carbon Super Star" for each
                            day/week/month/year
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To build a mobile app that can be used to create a "Garbage Map".<br/><br/>

                            Version 1: The students will make a note of places in their area where garbage is dumped
                            that is unhygienic and/or illegal. These places are marked on a map so that people can have
                            a idea
                            how clean or unclean the area they live in. By entering data on a daily basis, we will be
                            able to see how the garbage map evolve. We can also have levels of severity for the
                            unhygienic and/or illegal condition and use this addition data to make a color coded
                            map.<br/>
                            Version 2: The app should allow the map data to be uploaded to a central server. The server
                            could publish a "Top-Ten" list of most garbage strewn areas.

                            Mobile Application development.
                            Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL) is the largest and the apex engineering body in
                            the country. Established in 1956, currently it has an active membership around 16,000.The
                            Information Technology and Communications Engineering Sectional Committee of the IESL
                            organizes this competition annually, to promote software development among school students
                            and to recognize their talents as the next generation of professionals in the country.
                            University of Moratuwa is a leading university in Sri Lanka which currently consists of
                            three faculties. Computer Science and Engineering Department that belongs to the Faculty of
                            Engineering is one of the two departments in Sri Lanka along with University of Peradeniya
                            to offer an engineering degree in computer science. Annually the department involves in
                            organizing many events apart from the academic activities in order to improve the ICT
                            knowledge and skills among the young students in Sri Lanka.</p>

                        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS EVENT?</h5>

                        <p>Most of the Sri Lankan students are interested in mobile application development but the main
                            constraint for them is lack of knowledge and facilities. Only very few schools have well
                            equipped ICT laboratories and resources persons. Main idea of organizing this event is to
                            provide assistance for students to learn the art of mobile application development and
                            ultimately give them an opportunity to make use of what they have learnt and showcase their
                            talents.</p>
