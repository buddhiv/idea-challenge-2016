                        <p>Most of the Sri Lankan students are interested in mobile application development but the main
                            constraint for them is lack of knowledge and facilities. Only very few schools have well
                            equipped ICT laboratories and resources persons. Main idea of organizing this event is to
                            provide assistance for students to learn the art of mobile application development and
                            ultimately give them an opportunity to make use of what they have learnt and showcase their
                            talents.</p>
